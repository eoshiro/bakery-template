#Notes
This project is currently underconstruction.  Looking to add Django-Shop to Django-CMS.  To duplicate the project:

1.  create environment with Anaconda3.0
2.  Install the following packages into the created environment:
	1) Django 3.0.6
	2) python-decouple 3.3
	3) django-crispy-forms 1.9.1
	4) django-floppyforms 1.9.0
3. add appropriate information into the .env file located in the main directory
**do not host your personal information located in the .env file in production**
4.  create a superuser
5.  remember to makemigrations and migrate


Please note the routing in the python files
and the template tags for the form in the HTML.
